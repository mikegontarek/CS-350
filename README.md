# CS-350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - The purpose of the project was to use the TI SimpleLink WiFi CC3220S microcontroller to record data about the temperature and display it.  The microcontroller was to also use LEDs and buttons to display information as well as reset the process.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  - What I did particularly well was my state machines. I believe that they are functional and make sense when you take a quick glance at them. 
  
Where could you improve?
  - the area of improvement is getting rid of the errors so that the system displays the proper information.  I was not able to get the code to work with the board unfortunately. 
  
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
 - The resources that I am adding to my support network are the information sheets about the microprocessors.  I believe that these will have all of the information and resources I should need if I get stuck using one of these boards in the future.
 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  - The ability to use UARTs and GPIOs will benefit me in the future if I decide to get into embedded programming.  However, I do not plan on doing that.  I want to make websites as well as apps as that is why I started to learn to code in the first place. 
  
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The way I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable is that I ensured that my code whether it was right or wrong was well documented and followed standard programming procedures.
